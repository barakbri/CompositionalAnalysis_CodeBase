See readme on upper directory for instructions on how to install codebase, run, and reproduce paper results.

## Note:
The file `zinbwave_imported_functions` is a script with additional functions used for running ZINB-WAVE+DESEQ2 as in Calgaro et al. 2020. The functions were taken from the GitHub repository https://github.com/mcalgaro93/sc2meta showing how to use Deseq2 + Zinb-Wave for Microbiome data. See additional comments in file.
